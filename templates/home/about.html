              Gardening is a fulfilling yet often challenging activity, especially for urban dwellers with limited space, knowledge, and time. As we delved into the world of home gardening, we discovered a common themeâ€”people love the idea of growing their own plants but struggle with maintaining them. To address this, we created The Garden Hub, an AI-powered platform offering expert-backed solutions to make gardening easier and more accessible for everyone.
